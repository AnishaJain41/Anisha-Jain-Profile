My name is Anisha Jain, and I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Northern Illinois University. I specialize in labor economics and econometrics. My interest in labor economics drove my ongoing research which focuses on dynamics of labor productivity and it's relationship with compensation and capital intensity.


### Background
My Ph.D. journey at Northern Illinois University came with lots of opportunities including a Masters of Science in Statistics, teaching Microeconomics at both graduate as well as undergraduate level, teaching Mathematics for Economics, working as a research assistant with Nonprofit and NGO Studies department, and being part of Association of Graduate Economic Students (AGES) as a Secretary. Additionally, outside Northern Illinois University, I was involved in an internship with Workforce and Organizational Research Centre (WORC) as a data analyst.

Prior to Northern Illinois University, I interned with LanzaTech in 2019 - 2020 as a business analyst. Prior to that I graduated from University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee in 2019, where I studied econometrics and industrial organization apart from microeconomics and macroeconomics
