I am Anisha Jain and I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Northern Illinois University. I specialize in labor economics and econometrics. My interest in labor economics drove my ongoing research which focuses on dynamics of labor productivity and it's linkage with compensation and capital intensity.


### Background
My Ph.D. journey at Northern Illinois University came with lots of opportunities including a Masters of Science in Statistics, teaching Microeconomics at both graduate as well as undergraduate level, teaching Mathematics for Economics, working as a research assistant with Nonprofit and NGO Studies department, and being part of Association of Graduate Economic Students (AGES) as a Secretary. Additionally, outside Northern Illinois University, I was involved in an internship with Workforce and Organizational Research Centre (WORC) as a data analyst.

Prior to Northern Illinois University, I interned with LanzaTech as a business analyst after graduating from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 2019 with a Master of Arts in Economics. At University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, I specialized in econometrics and industrial organization while expanding my knowledge in Microeconomics and Macroeconomics. The journey into economics goes back to my undergraduate studies at Shiv Nadar Univiersity, India where I earned Bachelor of Science (Research) in Economics with my research focus on Labor Economics.
